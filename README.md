# Overview
This repo contains projects from BME/CS 479 - Wearables and Nearables Technology Laboratory


# Course Description: 
Students will gain practical experience designing and developing wearable and nearable devices. Acquisition and processing of sensor data. Design and development
of user-friendly interfaces.


# Course Objectives: 
The course is intended to provide students with an understanding of:
+ Wearable and nearable devices
+ Wearable and nearable technology can be applied in sports, fitness, medicine, assistive devices, and rehabilitation devices.
+ User Interface design for wearable technology
+ Internet of Things


# Class Projects:
## SparkBeat - Smart Heartrate and Blood Oxygenation Wristband
Description: This project uses the Sparkfun Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Monitor (MAX30101 & MAX32664) and FIREBEETLE BOARD-32P BLE 4.1, which together allows us to measure heart rates and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), providing insights into the wearer's cardiovascular health. Data is transmitted via BLE for real-time monitoring.
  + Photoplethysmogram (PPG) Sensors
  + Stress indicative buzzer
  
Here is how the application looks when monitoring heart rate in real-time as well as the circuit diagram and packaging:

## SparkBeat 2 - Wearable Sport Band
Description: This project uses the FireBeetle Board-328P with BLE4.1 x 2, FireBeetle Proto Board, AD8232 Heart Monitor, ECG Leads and Snap-On ECG electrodes, and Force Sensitive Resistors (FSR) to collect clean ECG signals from the patient’s heart and measure respiratory rate through analyzing resistance changes when the patient exhales and inhales.
  + ECG Sensors and breathing sensors
  + Fitness, Stress, and Meditation Modes

## TikTok Tattoo - Interactive Tattoos – Smart Tattoo Lab
Description: This project uses the MPR 121 Breakout Board to create a Smart Tattoo that would allow us to control external devices like the TikTok Web with a simple
swipe on your skin.
  + Capacitive Sensing


## Wearables for Motion and Gait Analysis
Description: TBD
  + Force sensors and accelerometers


## Dehydration Detector
Description: TBD
